## <img src="../img/software.png" height="50px"> Software & Hardware
- [srsRAN](https://github.com/srsran): An open-source 4G/5G software-defined radio protocol stack, offering full LTE/5G NSA/SA implementations for base stations (eNB/gNB) and user equipment (UE), supporting O-RAN architecture, widely used in research and commercial deployments.
- [GNURadio](https://www.gnuradio.org/): An open-source SDR framework with modular signal processing blocks (C++/Python), enabling graphical programming for rapid prototyping of wireless systems (e.g., radios, radars).
- [LabVIEW NXG](https://www.ni.com/en/shop/labview/labview-nxg.html?srsltid=AfmBOooRMjXDsDt3MoBw6HAy78LZgCFT6jQMkNi6huSX1wQfY4or-gMy): A graphical systems engineering software by NI (now succeeded by newer LabVIEW versions), focused on automated testing, data acquisition, and instrument control, suited for industrial and research applications.
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html): A numerical computing and algorithm development platform, featuring toolboxes for signal processing and communication system simulations (e.g., Simulink, 5G Toolbox), widely adopted in academia and industry.
- [USRP SDR](https://www.ettus.com/products/): A software-defined radio hardware platform by Ettus Research (NI subsidiary), supporting wideband RF signal transceivers (70 MHz–6 GHz), often paired with GNURadio/MATLAB for flexible communication experiments.
- [mmWave Beamforming](): A millimeter-wave (30–300 GHz) beamforming technique using phased-array antennas to achieve high-directional signal transmission, addressing high-frequency path loss, and core to 5G NR standards.
