Project Overview

Secure Device Trust Bootstrapping Against Collaborative Signal Modification Attacks (IEEE INFOCOM 2023) explores new methods to establish trust among wireless devices without relying on pre-shared secrets or additional hardware.
Traditional in-band authentication (IBA) protocols are often vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where adversaries can cancel or inject RF signals to manipulate communication channels.
This work introduces a novel software-based trust bootstrapping protocol that leverages each deviceâ€™s internal randomness to detect and resist collaborative signal modification attacks.

Key Contributions

In-band security: Trust bootstrapping performed directly over RF communication without requiring extra hardware.

Resilience against colluding attackers: First solution that thwarts multiple adversaries coordinating signal cancellation attacks.

Internal randomness: Devices randomly flip bits in authentication messages, making modifications detectable with high probability.

Experimental validation: Implemented and tested on USRP-based testbed, demonstrating high detection probability even under strong attacker models.

Impact

This research strengthens the foundation of secure device pairing for IoT, mobile, and mission-critical systems, where heterogeneous devices must collaborate securely in real-world environments. It has implications for NextG, ISAC, and O-RAN security frameworks.
