## <img src="../img/career.png" height="50px"> My career
For a brief and compact overview, take a look at my 1-page [CV](../documents/Hauff_shortCV.pdf). 

I received my Bachelor's Degree from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), department of [Communication Engineering](https://dce.jlu.edu.cn/). Then I finished my Master's Degree at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/), department of Electrical Engineering. I joined [AISecLab](https://www.stevens.edu/icns-center-for-innovative-computing-and-networked-systems/aiseclab) at SIT, and been supervised by Prof. Shucheng Yu.
