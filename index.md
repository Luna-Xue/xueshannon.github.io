## <img src="../img/career.png" height="50px"> About Me
My research focuses on advancing wireless communication by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) with 5G, Sub-6G, NextG, and beyond. I specialize in enhancing security and efficiency in next-generation networks through Physical Layer Security (PLS), millimeter wave (mmWave) sensing, and AI-driven techniques.

Currently, I work on Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) for real-time, contactless applications and privacy-preserving distributed IoT systems using confidential computing. Additionally, I explore innovations in O-RAN networks, focusing on AI/ML workflows, security challenges, and standardization. My goal is to improve the resilience, reliability, and trustworthiness of future wireless networks, ensuring secure and intelligent connectivity.

I received my Bachelor's Degree from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), department of [Communication Engineering](https://dce.jlu.edu.cn/). Then I finished my Master's Degree at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/), department of Electrical Engineering. I joined [AISecLab](https://www.stevens.edu/icns-center-for-innovative-computing-and-networked-systems/aiseclab) at SIT, and been supervised by Prof. Shucheng Yu.
